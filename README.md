# Student Performance Predictor

![student](https://github.com/Godwin45/student-app/assets/71969710/a6cb7302-6f1e-4f56-a2f4-a34c0f2e9098)

The Student Performance Predictor is a software application designed to predict the math score of a student based on specific inputs such as writing score and reading score. This tool utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide accurate and reliable predictions, allowing educators and administrators to gain insights into students' academic performance.

## Features

- Predicts math scores based on writing and reading scores.
- Includes features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course to improve prediction accuracy.
- Easy-to-use interface for seamless data input and prediction retrieval.
- Deployed in the AWS Cloud for scalable and reliable performance.
- Utilizes Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Git Actions for streamlined development and deployment.

## How It Works

The Student Performance Predictor utilizes a machine learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset of student information, including writing scores, reading scores, and various demographic factors. The model uses these inputs to make predictions on the math score, which is often an essential indicator of a student's overall academic performance.

When using the application, users input the relevant data, including writing and reading scores, as well as additional demographic information such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course. The predictor then processes this information using the trained machine learning model to generate an estimated math score for the student.

## Deployment in AWS Cloud

The Student Performance Predictor has been deployed in the AWS Cloud to ensure high availability, scalability, and optimal performance. AWS provides a reliable infrastructure that allows the application to handle multiple user requests simultaneously while maintaining responsive performance.

## CI/CD with Git Actions

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Git Actions have been implemented to automate the development and deployment process. With each code commit to the repository, the CI/CD pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys the latest version of the software to the AWS Cloud. This ensures that any changes or improvements to the application are quickly and safely deployed to production.

## Getting Started

To use the Student Performance Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies and libraries (provide instructions if applicable).
3. Run the application on your local development environment.
4. Input the student's writing score, reading score, gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course.
5. Click the "Predict" button to obtain the predicted math score.
